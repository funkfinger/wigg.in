I"	<p>Based on Atmel’s <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc8020.pdf">AVR136: Low-Jitter Multi-Channel Software PWM</a> Application note, here’s a 3 channel software-based pulse width modulator to drive a RGB LED. This is a proof of concept and currently there is some in-efficient color cycling code in there, but the goal is to drive these cheap chips using an I2C (two wire serial) bus. Disco dance floor anyone?…</p>
