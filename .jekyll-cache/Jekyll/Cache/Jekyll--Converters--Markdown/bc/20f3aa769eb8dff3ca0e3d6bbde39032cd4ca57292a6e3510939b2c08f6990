I"Ú<p>So, Iâ€™ve never dabbled in C until now while using it with AVR microcontrollers - and while trying to complie a simple for loop:</p>

<pre lang="c">
  for (uint8_t bit = 0x80; bit; bit &gt;&gt;= 1) {
    ...
  }
</pre>

<p>I got this error:</p>

<pre>error: 'for' loop initial declaration used outside C99 mode</pre>

<p>and to fix it I would move my decloration of the varabile outside of the loop. This seemed stupid to me so a quick Google search turned up <a href="http://cplusplus.syntaxerrors.info/index.php?title='for'_loop_initial_declaration_used_outside_C99_mode">this</a></p>

<blockquote>Back in the old days, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and programmers used punch cards, you were not allowed to declare variables anywhere except at the very beginning of a block.</blockquote>

<p>Solution was to add <code>-std=c99</code> to the Makefile. My new AVR Makefile now looks like this..</p>
