I"„<p>Iâ€™ve been fighting this issue the last couple nights. I wrote earlier about how <code>Rack::PostBodyContentTypeParser</code> can automagically turn a posted JSON object into a Rack / Sinatra params hash. So, I wrote some tests to make sure this was the case and moved on. Well, it turns out in real life things werenâ€™t working and I couldnâ€™t figure out why. Everything looked cool, but the hash wasnâ€™t getting set when I did an AJAX call in the browser - everything was empty. I looked at everything, from the server, to the JS library, to the browser, to setting different content types in <code>prototype.js</code> etcâ€¦ UGH!</p>
