I"X<p>I have a <a href="https://www.teenageengineering.com/products/po">Teenage Engineering Pocket Operator (PO-12)</a> and it’s pretty cool. One thing I felt was missing, though, was a way to tap a button to set the BPM value - the 3 presets (Hip-Hop, Disco, Techno) and dial adjust isn’t very specific. It does however have a sync feature that allows you to connect multiple Pocket Operators together (and I’ve heard some other devices as well) - and keep them in sync… which got me thinking, could one create the sync signal using some simple electronics and programming? Project time…</p>
