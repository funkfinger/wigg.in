I"Ó<p>OSH Park pretty much rules. This was my first toe into making a PCB to be produced. I used <a href="https://cadsoft.io/">Eagle</a> to design it and <a href="https://oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a> to get it made. A week or so later, I got these boards in the mail:</p>

<p>I added a combination of female and male headers to the Dragon and a ziff socket in the programing area. The completed board and Dragon look like this:</p>

<p>See Fig 6-5 in the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42723-AVR-Dragon_UserGuide.pdf">AVR Dragon User Guide</a> for how this is hooked up. Feel free to order this board fron <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/dpRLKfmm">OSH Park</a></p>
