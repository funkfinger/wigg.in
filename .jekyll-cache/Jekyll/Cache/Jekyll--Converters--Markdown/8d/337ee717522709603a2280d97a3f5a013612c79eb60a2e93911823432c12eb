I"A<p>Here’s a quick (couple hours with my sloppy mistakes) mashup of two Arduino examples - the ES8266 (HUZZAH from Adafruit) WiFi controller and a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. This is the start of a bigger project which tells outdoor and indoor temperature along with accurate time (more on that to come), and probably wind speed, etc…</p>

<p>Here’s (sort of) what the circuit looks like:

<p>Here’s a photo of the protoboard:

<p>and here’s the quick mashup code of the two example:</p>
