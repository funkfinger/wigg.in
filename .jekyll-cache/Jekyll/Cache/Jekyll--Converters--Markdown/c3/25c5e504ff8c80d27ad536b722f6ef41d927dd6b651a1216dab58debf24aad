I"<p>I’m digging up some old code that I did a long time ago - It’s a software-based pulse width modulator (PWM) for AVR microprocessors. The basics came from <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8020.pdf">this technote</a>, and the code was based on <a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/sites/default/files/AVR136.zip">this sample project</a> from AVR.</p>

<p>I originally wanted to have this run 2 RGB LEDs from an ATtiny85 but I steered away from that because I was going to have to use the reset pin as an output and then I ran across this in the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2586-AVR-8-bit-Microcontroller-ATtiny25-ATtiny45-ATtiny85_Datasheet.pdf">ATtiny datasheet - Table 21-1, page 162</a>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>6. The RESET pin must tolerate high voltages when entering and operating in programming modes and, as a consequence,
has a weak drive strength as compared to regular I/O pins. See Figure 22-23, Figure 22-24, Figure 22-25, and Figure 22-26
(starting on page 184).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks like I can’t drive an LED with the reset as an output directly. Bummer. No big deal using a bigger (more pins) AVR chip, but I thought it was cool to get two PWM-ed RGB LEDs out of an 8-pin chip.</p>
