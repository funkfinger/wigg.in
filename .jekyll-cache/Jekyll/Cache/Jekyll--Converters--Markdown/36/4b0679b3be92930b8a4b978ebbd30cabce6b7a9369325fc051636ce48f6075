I"½<p>This is simple, but Iâ€™m dumping it here anywayâ€¦ Iâ€™d like to use the Twitter model of account access: <strong>http://example.com/USERNAME</strong></p>

<p>So, if the user exists, if should display that userâ€™s page. If the user doesnâ€™t exist (or the user is deactivated) then this route will pass, which in this case, passes to the 404 error page. Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™m dealing with that in my routes:</p>

<pre lang="ruby" line="1">
    get '/:username' do
      @user=User.first(:username=&gt;params[:username],:activated=&gt;true)
      pass unless @user
      haml :user_page
    end
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>This should be low on the chain of routes so that users with names or actual routes canâ€™t be rendered as user pages. Example, a user with a username of â€œloginâ€ should not interfere with the application function of â€œloginâ€. I might look further into protecting this beyond itâ€™s position in the URL parsing chain.</p>
