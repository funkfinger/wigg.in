I"q<p>I’m continuing to try and ‘cheap-ify’ my per effect cost for my Halloween decorations. I ran into some issues last night trying to get an Arduino sketch that used the Adafruit Neopixel library and ran on a Trinket to run on a straight ATtiny85. The solution was to select the chip in the Arduino IDE and using an AVR programmer, burn the ‘bootloader’.</p>
